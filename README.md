# QR2P2P

A decentralized QR paycode marketplace connecting global payment systems through Bitcoin, Lightning, and eCash settlements.

## Overview

QR2P2P enables seamless cross-border payments by allowing users to upload QR codes from local fiat payment systems (PromptPay, QRIS, UPI, etc.) and have them paid by "Earners" who are compensated in Bitcoin, Lightning, or eCash. This creates a bridge between traditional payment rails and the Bitcoin economy.

## Key Features

- **QR Code Marketplace**: Upload and browse payment QR codes from various fiat systems
- **Decentralized Matching**: Connect payment requesters with local earners
- **Bitcoin Settlements**: Earners receive Bitcoin, Lightning, or eCash compensation
- **Multi-Region Support**: Support for PromptPay (Thailand), QRIS (Indonesia), UPI (India), and more
- **Real-time Matching**: Instant pairing of payment requests with available earners
- **Escrow Protection**: Secure settlement mechanism protecting both parties
